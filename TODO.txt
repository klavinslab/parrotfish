PYFISH TODO
===========

Optimization
- pfish pull
  - Only load code content if write is necessary

Features
+ pfish set_remote [name] [url] [login?]
  + Save server login config in JSON for given repository
- Protocol testing
  - Run tests like in Developer tab (new Trident feature?)
  - Plan submission and debugging

Bigfixes
- More intelligently pull from OTs with conflicting names (prioritize by most recently updated and then id)
