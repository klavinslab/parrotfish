PYFISH TODO
===========

Optimization
- pfish pull
  - Only load code content if write is necessary

Features
- pfish add_remote [name] [url]
  - Save servers in JSON for given repository
  - pfish push/pull default to last added/last used but can take another name as argument

Bigfixes
- More intelligently pull from OTs with conflicting names (prioritize by most recently updated and then id)
